#Maker Parties - AppMaker

This guide was pulled together from a maker party that I held in December 2014 for 6-8 10-year olds who are interested in technology. It is losely remixed from a number of resources found on Mozilla sites:

* [Medium-sized maker party](https://michelle.makes.org/thimble/LTE1Nzc2NDgxMjg=/how-to-host-a-maker-party-medium)
* [Chef Game](https://mcbeckster.makes.org/thimble/NTc4NjgzMTM2/chef-adventure-game) _(what the participants will be building and then extending. Also see the [Resources](https://github.com/lpaglione/AppMakerParty/blob/master/Resources.md) file for other sample games.)_
* [Side Activity: KUMI paper toy](https://party.webmaker.org/party-resources/KUMI-Papertoy-blue.pdf) (which are super cute!)
* [Side Activity: Make your own t-shirt](https://tbx.makes.org/thimble/stencil-a-tshirt)

Others are welcome to branch and remix as you'd like!

###About AppMaker

[AppMaker](https://apps.webmaker.org/en-US/designer0) is a free tool for creating personal mobile apps, even if you don't know code! Combine individual bricks to create and share custom mobile apps right in your web browser.

You can build:
